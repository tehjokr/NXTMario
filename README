Hello!

This is the Lego Mindstorms NXT Mario Github project page!
In order to run NXT Mario, you can:

A) Download a binary (that means the ready to run game), and download it to the NXT

-or-

B) Download the source code (that means the human code that a computer must convert), compile it with BricxCC*, and download to the NXT

The binaries are in the folder called bin :-)
