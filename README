Hello!

This is the Lego Mindstorms NXT Mario Github project page!
In order to run NXT Mario, you can:

A) Download a binary (that means the ready to run game), and download it to the NXT

-or-

B) Download the source code (that means the human code that a computer must convert), compile it with BricxCC*, and download to the NXT

For now you'll need to install the NXC/NBC modified firmware that comes with Bricx Command Center in order for the game to run. If you can get it to run without, please send an email!
